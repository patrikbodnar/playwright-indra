# playwright-indra
Assignment from company to create testing automation project in python using cucumber, pytest-bdd and playwright

Folders hierarchy:
- features  -  email.feature - cucumber file
            -  test_email.py - autogenerated test cases from email.feature
- pages     -  inbox_page.py - inbox page playwright functions
            -  login_page.py - login page playwright functions
            -  main_page.py - home page playwright functions
          -  message_page.py - message page playwright functions
- resources - attachment.txt
- workflows - email_workflow.py - python file to organize page functions into common functions


It was my first time doing such project as I briefly went throught python in school and I also never worked with pytest-dbb and playwright. It was a nice experience.
